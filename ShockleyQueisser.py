# ShockleyQueisser.py
#   implements the program interface used to start he calculator
#       execute ShockleyQueisser.py from the command line prompt by typing:
#           python -u ShockleyQueisser.py
#       or by double clicking on it (depending on the operating system settings)
#       or from within your editor, if possible.
#       in the graphical interface, change the parameters you want and press 'Calculate'.

# import the program core class in ShockleyQueisserCore.py

# 1. create an instance of the core class
# set verbose to True to enable printing output
# The calculator can be used in graphical (GUI) mode or command-line only mode. In command-line mode (useTkinterGUI = False) the results are printed out and saved in text files.
#   the command-line mode is useful to perform specific calculations such as multijunction solar cell efficiency (see example in README.md).
